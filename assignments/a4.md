### 🔹 Problem 1: Triangle Area Calculation
**Objective:**  
Create a class `Triangle` with properties `base` and `height`. Add a method called `area()` that returns the area using the formula:  
📌 `Area = (1/2) * base * height`

**Tasks:**
- Create at least **two triangle objects** with different values.
- Call the `area()` method on each object and print the result along with base and height.

**Sample Output:**
```
Triangle 1 - Base: 10, Height: 5, Area: 25
Triangle 2 - Base: 8, Height: 4, Area: 16
```

### 🔹 Problem 2: Rectangle Area and Perimeter
**Objective:**  
Create a class `Rectangle` with properties `length` and `width`. Add methods:
- `area()` to calculate area using `length * width`
- `perimeter()` to calculate perimeter using `2 * (length + width)`

**Tasks:**
- Create at least **two rectangle objects**.
- Display the area and perimeter for each rectangle.

**Sample Output:**
```
Rectangle 1 - Length: 10, Width: 5, Area: 50, Perimeter: 30
Rectangle 2 - Length: 6, Width: 3, Area: 18, Perimeter: 18
```
